# 🛒 Sales Dashboard

This project is an interactive **Sales Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, **Plotly Express**, and **Pandas**. The dashboard allows users to explore and analyze sales data from a supermarket, providing valuable insights through key performance indicators (KPIs), sales by product line, and sales by hour.

## 📊 Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter data based on city, customer type, and gender using the sidebar filters.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
  - Total sales
  - Average customer rating (with star visualization)
  - Average sales per transaction
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Sales by Product Line**: A horizontal bar chart showing the total sales for each product line.
  - **Sales by Hour**: A bar chart showing the total sales for each hour of the day.
- **Responsive Layout**: The dashboard is fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes for better user experience.
  
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `streamlit`
  - `pandas`
  - `plotly`

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas plotly
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ugochukwulumanze/sales-dashboad.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd sales-dashboard
   ```

3. **Prepare your data**:
   Make sure you have the `supermarket_sales.csv` file in the project directory. The dataset should have the following columns: `City`, `Customer_type`, `Gender`, `Total`, `Product_line`, `Rating`, and `Time`.

4. **Run the application**:
   Start the Streamlit app with the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **View the Dashboard**:
   Open your browser and navigate to the local URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).

## 📈 How It Works

The dashboard is divided into two main parts:

1. **Sidebar Filters**: Users can filter the data by city, customer type, and gender. The data visualizations and KPIs dynamically update based on the filters selected.
  
2. **Main Dashboard**:
   - **KPIs**: At the top of the dashboard, key metrics such as total sales, average customer rating, and average sales per transaction are displayed.
   - **Sales by Product Line**: This bar chart shows which product lines generate the most revenue.
   - **Sales by Hour**: This chart highlights sales trends based on the time of day.

## 📁 Data Source

The dashboard relies on the `supermarket_sales.csv` dataset, which contains sales records from a supermarket. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **City**: The location of the supermarket
- **Customer_type**: The type of customer (e.g., Member, Normal)
- **Gender**: Customer gender
- **Total**: Total sales amount for a transaction
- **Product_line**: The product category
- **Rating**: Customer rating for the service
- **Time**: The time of the transaction

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Modifying Filters**: You can add additional filters to the sidebar by modifying the `multiselect` components.
- **New Charts**: You can easily add new charts or change existing ones by using the `plotly.express` library.
- **Data Source**: Replace the `supermarket_sales.csv` with your own dataset by updating the `get_data()` function.
